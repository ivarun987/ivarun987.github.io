	<h1>Hi there, I'm Varun Jain!</h1>
	<p>I am a current student at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics. I am leaning towards software development and programming and plan to graduate Spring 2019. Some interesting classes I've taken so far include Big Data and Algorithms!

Outside of school and projects, I like to listen to alternative/indie/electronic music, play the piano, fold 3 Dimensional Modular Origami, and love to be different.

Feel free to check out my resume and links below, or contact me if you have any questions!</em> Don't trust me. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
