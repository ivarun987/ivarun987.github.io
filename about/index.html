	<h1>About Me!</h1>
	<p>I am a current student at the University of Pennsylvania,
	majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics. I am leaning
	towards software development and programming and plan to graduate
	Spring 2019. Some interesting classes I've taken so far include
	Big Data and Algorithms! Outside of school and projects, I like
	to listen to alternative/indie/electronic music, play the piano,
	fold 3 Dimensional Modular Origami, and love to be different.
	Feel free to check out my resume and links below, or contact me
	if you have any questions!</p>
